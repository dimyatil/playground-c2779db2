## Why?

If you make an application or library that you want to share with the world, it is very important to also provide detailed documentation otherwise noone will ant to use what you created. Writing documentation is not what many coders dream about, but there are some nice tools that can lessen the burden.

The concept is not to have a 'documentation project' completely separate from your coding project, but to keep the technical documentation near your code. With the right tool, you can generate the interface documentation automatically from your code, using some DocBlocks and the code itself as the single source of truth.
