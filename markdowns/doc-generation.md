# Generating documentation (_phpDocumentor_)

__As your CG puzzle solutions are meant for your own eyes only, this chapter is irrelevent in the context of CodinGame.__

## Why

If you make code that you share with the world to be used, it is very important to provide proper detailed documentation. Writing documentation is not what many coders dream about, but there are tools that can lessen the burden.

The concept is not to have a completely separate documentation project besides your code repository, but to keep the technical documentation near the code and to generate the interface documentation automatically from your code, using some DocBlocks and the code itself as the source of truth.
